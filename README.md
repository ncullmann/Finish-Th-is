# Finish-Th-(is)
Finish Th-(is) is an application that brings the convenience of a mobile keyboard's predictive text to the desktop, system-wide.
It works the same way you would expect your phone's keyboard to -- often times completely finishing sentences for you.

# Building
This project was built using the [Azul Zulu OpenJDK with JavaFX](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk-fx). 
However, this project also builds with other recent JDKs assuming both dependencies are met.
On the first compilation, the pm.ser and stn.ser files are generated from the training set, and will not be regenerated unless deleted.
The binaries come with both of these for the sake of convenience.
### Dependencies
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) - only required for alternative JDKs<br>
